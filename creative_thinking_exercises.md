## Born Creative

We all come into this world as creative little beings.  
Give any small child some wooden blocks, and before you know it, they've built a ship or a house.

So what happened?

- Education and the pressure to "get things right"
- Social expectations to conform
- The rise of **convergent thinking** — seeking correctness and fitting in

These are the **opposites of creative thinking**, which lives in the unruly world of **divergent thinking**.

## The Magic of Sleeping on It

John Cleese of Monty Python describes how *sleeping on a problem* works:

> *"At night I’d be stuck writing a sketch. But in the morning, after sleep and coffee,  
> the solution was immediately obvious — and I couldn’t even remember what the problem was!"*

This highlights how our minds **keep working subconsciously**, making creativity bloom.

## Practice Makes Creative
