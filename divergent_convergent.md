## Convergent and Divergent Thinking

People in organizations are often well trained in dissecting problems, analyzing them, and making decisions. However, culturally, we are not as well trained in coming up with new ideas.

*Convergent thinking* and *divergent thinking* are both essential parts of the creative process—generating ideas and deciding what to do with them.

The best way to explain divergent and convergent thinking is through an exercise.

Try using your body to reach for the stars. This physical motion can make you feel empowered and energized.
Comments from students:

*"It felt like I was stretching muscles I haven't stretched in a while."*

*"It felt like it was waking me up."*

Divergent thinking is about generating ideas and exploring new possibilities. To come up with something new, you often have to “reach out,” explore broadly, and mentally go to expansive, open places—what we often call “blue sky” thinking.

In contrast, try bending down to touch your toes. Many people report feeling heavier, more restricted, or more introspective in this position.

Convergent thinking involves narrowing down ideas, reflecting on them, refining them, and ultimately making decisions. In yoga, forward-bending poses are often associated with introspection and reflection—much like the role of convergent thinking in the creative process.

So, divergent thinking is expansive and exploratory, while convergent thinking whne you're more focused and analytical.

Naysayers tend to avoid the exploration of ideas, so ideas never take place.
One of the essential rules in the creative process is to dedicate a set amount of time—whatever that may be—solely to generating ideas without judging or filtering them. During this phase, it's important to let ideas flow freely, without holding them back.

Only after this idea-generation phase should you deliberately and distinctly shift into the next stage: evaluating, refining, and deciding what to do with those ideas. Keeping these phases separate is crucial for creativity to thrive.
