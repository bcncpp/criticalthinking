# Welcome to Creativity

In a previous video, we looked at **curiosity** and its role in feeding creativity.  Today, we'll examine **creativity** and its importance if your ultimate goal is innovative critical thinking and problem solving.

## So What Is So Magical About Creativity?

Well, honestly ‚Äî nothing.  
Oh, I know it *can* seem magical. But really, it isn't. Here's why:

> **Creativity is in all of us**, although it may be hidden away in some dark corner some of us haven't visited in a long time.

---

## What *Is* Creativity?

There are many definitions out there, but one that stands out is:

> *"The ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, and patterns, and to create meaningful new ideas."*

Because when it comes down to it, **creating something new and valuable** is the goal.

## What Is Creative Thinking?

According to Edward de Bono ‚Äî one of the great thinkers on creativity:

> **"Creative thinking is a skill. It's not just talent or sitting by a river playing Baroque music hoping to get inspired. That's very weak stuff."**

So what *isn't* the weak stuff?

## Where Do Creative Ideas Come From?

Let‚Äôs hear from the famously creative **John Cleese**:

> ‚ÄúPeople ask me where I get my ideas from. I tell them I get them from a Mr. Ken Levingshore in Swindon‚Ä¶  
> He gets them from a lady named Mildred Spong on the Isle of Wight‚Ä¶ and she refuses to say where *she* gets them from.‚Äù

**The point?** We don't *really* know where ideas come from ‚Äî but we *do* know they don't come from our laptops.

## Don‚Äôt Despair ‚Äî You *Can* Encourage Creativity

Edward de Bono said:

> **"A simple way to spark creativity is just to stop and look."**

Creative thinking is **not a mystery** ‚Äî it's a capability we all have.  
The key is to find what approaches work best *for you*.

I‚Äôll be sharing several ways to help spark creativity.  
Try as many as you can ‚Äî not all will work for everyone, and that‚Äôs okay.

## Divergent Thinking

Creative thinking is a **divergent** type of thinking.  
It‚Äôs your brain going off in multiple directions.

> If we all thought alike, humanity wouldn't get very far.  
> Divergent thinking ultimately improves our critical thinking too.


*Divergent thinking* is a cognitive process used to generate many different ideas or solutions to a single open-ended question or problem. It's often associated with creativity, brainstorming, and thinking outside the box.
Key Features of Divergent Thinking:

- Fluency: Producing lots of ideas quickly.
- Flexibility: Thinking in varied categories or perspectives.
- Originality: Coming up with novel or unique ideas.
- Elaboration: Expanding on ideas with detail.

Example:

If asked, ‚ÄúWhat can you do with a paperclip?‚Äù a divergent thinker might say:

1. Hold papers together
2. Make jewelry
3. Pick a lock
4. Build a mini sculpture
5. Use it as a phone reset tool

This contrasts with convergent thinking, which focuses on finding the single best or correct answer, like in a math problem.

## Creativity, Curiosity & Critical Thinking

These three are like **spokes on a wheel** ‚Äî each one reinforcing the others, all leading toward effective problem solving.

---

## Why Is Creative Thinking Important?

Whether in your work life or personal life, creative thinking matters.
A 2014 study by Adobe and Forrester Consulting found:

- 82% of companies believe there‚Äôs a strong connection between **creativity** and **business results**
- Creative companies outperform others in **revenue**, **market share**, and **competitive leadership**
- Yet, **61% of companies** do *not* see themselves as creative

## How Can You Change This?

In your organization ‚Äî or even in your own life ‚Äî change starts by **intentionally encouraging creativity**.

- Encouraging curiosity: Ask open-ended questions and explore unconventional ideas without judgment.

- Creating safe spaces: People need to feel safe to take risks, share ideas, and make mistakes.

- Allowing time and space: Innovation rarely happens under pressure. Set aside dedicated time and distraction-free environments for creative thinking.

- Rewarding experimentation: Celebrate efforts, not just outcomes. Creativity thrives when people feel their ideas are valued.

## Creativity

Key Idea: *The key to entering a creative state is to avoid interruptions*.

We often get our best ideas unconsciously, from the part of the mind that works while we sleep. So, how can you create the right mood that allows creativity to flourish?

Think of your creative mind as a shy tortoise. It needs to feel safe before it will come out and explore. If you're constantly stressed or distracted, creativity retreats. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential to build an "oasis" in your life‚Äîa calm, protected space where ideas can emerge. This oasis requires two main things:

- *Boundaries of Space*: Choose a place where you won‚Äôt be interrupted. Go for a walk in the park, find a quiet corner, or designate a specific creative zone.

- *Boundaries of Time*: Set clear starting and ending times for your creative sessions. Structure gives freedom for ideas to arise.

Remember, we don‚Äôt always know where our ideas come from‚Äîbut it‚Äôs definitely not from forcing ourselves in front of a laptop. Ideas often arrive when we are relaxed, daydreaming, or doing something unrelated.

And here‚Äôs a thought-provoking insight: Knowing how good you are at something requires the same skills needed to be good at it. In other words, if you're truly bad at something, you may also lack the ability to recognize your own lack of skill. This is a profound realization‚Äîmany people are unaware of their own limitations simply because they don't have the tools to recognize them.
