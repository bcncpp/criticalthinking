## So What Is So Magical About Creativity?

Well, honestly — nothing.  
Oh, I know it *can* seem magical. But really, it isn't. Here's why:

> **Creativity is in all of us**, although it may be hidden away in some dark corner some of us haven't visited in a long time.

## What *Is* Creativity?

There are many definitions out there, but one that stands out is:

> *"The ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, and patterns, and to create meaningful new ideas."*

Because when it comes down to it, **creating something new and valuable** is the goal.

## What Is Creative Thinking?

According to Edward de Bono — one of the great thinkers on creativity:

> **"Creative thinking is a skill. It's not just talent or sitting by a river playing Baroque music hoping to get inspired. That's very weak stuff."**

So what *isn't* the weak stuff?

## Where Do Creative Ideas Come From?

Let’s hear from the famously creative **John Cleese**:

> “People ask me where I get my ideas from. I tell them I get them from a Mr. Ken Levingshore in Swindon…  
> He gets them from a lady named Mildred Spong on the Isle of Wight… and she refuses to say where *she* gets them from.”

**The point?** We don't *really* know where ideas come from — but we *do* know they don't come from our laptops.

## Don’t Despair — You *Can* Encourage Creativity

Edward de Bono said:

> **"A simple way to spark creativity is just to stop and look."**

Creative thinking is **not a mystery** — it's a capability we all have.  
The key is to find what approaches work best *for you*.

I’ll be sharing several ways to help spark creativity.  
Try as many as you can — not all will work for everyone, and that’s okay.

## Divergent Thinking

Creative thinking is a **divergent** type of thinking.  
It’s your brain going off in multiple directions.

> If we all thought alike, humanity wouldn't get very far.  
> Divergent thinking ultimately improves our critical thinking too.
