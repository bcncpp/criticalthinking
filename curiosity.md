## Curiosity at the Core

You might be wondering why a quote about curiosity from Albert Einstein is on the screen right now.  
It's because **curiosity is at the core of creative thinking**.

And it's **creative thinking combined with critical thinking** that gives all of us the best chance at becoming **super problem solvers**.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. You're here to learn about *critical thinking and problem solving*.  
But have you ever wondered why some people seem to be naturals at these skills?

Well, if you have — congratulations! You've already been practicing curiosity.  
If not, I'm here to help.

## Critical and Creative Thinking: The Dynamic Duo

People who are good at problem solving usually bring two key skills to the table:

1. **Critical Thinking**  
   - More analytical  
   - Involves questioning and analyzing based on what we know  
   - Asks: **What? Why? How?**

2. **Creative Thinking**  
   - Connects bits of information in new and interesting ways  
   - Asks: **What if? Why not?**

These bits of information — let’s call them *dots* — are things we’ve seen or learned over time.

> The more dots we have, the more likely we are to come up with creative solutions.

As Steve Jobs famously said:  
> *“We cannot connect the dots looking forward, we can only connect them looking back.”*

But in a sense, he was wrong. Our creative brain **can** connect them looking forward — *that’s* creative thinking.

## Where Do the Dots Come From?

Great question.

They come from everything we've **learned and seen along life’s journey**.  
Those with more dots are typically those who have stayed **curious**, always asking and wondering about the world.

## How to Stay Curious

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but here are some proven tips (check out this week's infographic for more):

- **Always challenge what you see and hear**  
- **Ask people, not Google**

### Challenge What You See and Hear

Might be the easiest *and* the hardest.  
It’s easy to accept things as they are. But the curious brain wants to know **more**.

Examples:
- Why does the moon rise and set in different places each night?
- How is text displayed on a computer screen?

### Ask People, Not Google

Yes, you *can* Google everything.  
But — how much of it do you actually **remember**?

If someone explains it to you, you’re:
- More likely to remember it
- More likely to **connect it** to other things
- Learning with **human context**, which makes it stick

## Try It Today

Can I suggest you try a few curiosity activities today?  
No time like the present!

## More Benefits of Curiosity

### 1. Keeps Your Mind Active  
Curious people are always asking and searching — their minds are constantly *exercising*, and like a muscle, it gets stronger over time.

### 2. Expands Mental Horizons  
Curiosity creates anticipation for new ideas.  
If you're not curious, ideas can pass you by without recognition.

> *"Makes you wonder, doesn't it? How many great ideas have I missed because I wasn't curious?"*

### 3. Makes Life More Interesting  
If you’re always curious, **boredom doesn’t stand a chance**.  
Curiosity turns the ordinary into something worth examining.

> Lack of interest is often just a lack of curiosity.

## Back to Einstein

If one of the greatest minds said:

> *"I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious."*

…why not take that seriously and **make curiosity a conscious part of your life**?

## Final Recap

- **Curiosity boosts creative thinking**
- **Creative + critical thinking = better problem solving**
- **Curiosity keeps your mind sharp**
- **Einstein said it best: _I am only passionately curious_**
